| Algorithm                  | A procedure for solving a methematiccal problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves the repition of an operation. |
| Properties of an Algorithm |                                                              |
| Definiteness               | Each step must be precisely defined. Actions to be carried out must be specified for each case. |
| Effectiveness              | Operations must be basic in order to be done in a finite length. |
| Finiteness                 | Must have an end, in order to produce an output.             |
| Machine-Independent        | Stays the same independent of hardware and software (language). |
| Correctness                | Always returns the desired output for all legall instances off the problem. |
| Efficiency                 | Running time (Time Complexity)<br />Memory requirement (Space Complexity)<br />Bandwidth (Communication Speed) |

| Sequence                       | Executing actions consecutively                              |
| Selection                      | Executing one or two actions  according to the value of an expresssion. (Descision-making construct) |
| Iteration                      | Repeatedly executing actions as long as an expression is true. |

| Natural Language        | Standardised description                                     |
| Pseudocode              | Pretends to be computer code, because it uses constructs of programming languages.<br />Syntax is not standardised. |
| Flowcharts              | A visual representation of an algorithm.<br />Well-defined and standardised<br />• Easy to understand symbols to represent steps.<br />• Visual Elements to represent constructs of programming languages. |

## What is Programming?

- Computer programming is the process of designing and building an **executable** computer program for accomplishing a **specific task**.

- Involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and     resource consumption, and implementation.

- Purpose of programming is to  find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task on a computer, often for solving a given problem.
	- Therefore requires expertise in several subjects specialised in  algorithms, and formal logic.

- A programming language is a vocabulary and a set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.
